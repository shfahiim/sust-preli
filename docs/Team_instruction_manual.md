# Team Instructions Manual

### AI/API Challenge · 4-Hour Online Preliminary

> **Read this first**
> This manual explains how to execute the preliminary round: read the problem, divide work, build the API, test it, deploy it, and submit the required deliverables. It should be read together with the Problem Statement and the Evaluation Rubric.

---

## 1. Participant Document Pack

| Document | Purpose | What it answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Problem Statement** | Defines the challenge, input/output schema, and required behavior. | What do we need to build? |
| **Evaluation Rubric** | Explains scoring categories, safety penalties, hidden tests, and tie-breakers. | How will we be judged? |
| **Team Instructions Manual** | Explains build flow, deployment options, secrets policy, testing, and submission. | How do we execute and submit? |

---

## 2. What Teams Need to Build

| Required item | Instruction |
| --- | --- |
| **API service** | Build a backend service for the preliminary challenge API. |
| **GET /health** | Must return `{"status":"ok"}`. This proves the service is running. |
| **POST main analysis endpoint** | Main endpoint. It must accept the required input JSON and return the required structured output JSON exactly as defined in the Problem Statement. |
| **Valid JSON response** | Use the exact required field names, types, and enum values from the problem statement. |
| **README.md** | Explain setup, run command, AI/model usage, safety logic, and known limitations. |

> 💡 **Frontend/UI is optional**
> A frontend or UI is not required for the preliminary round and will not be directly judged. Prioritize API correctness, reasoning quality, safety, reliability, deployment, and documentation.

---

## 3. Available Resources

| Resource | How teams may use it |
| --- | --- |
| **Poridhi Labs** | Use the provided lab environment for coding, testing, and deployment support. |
| **Poridhi VM** | Deploy the API service manually on a VM if provided. |
| **AWS through Poridhi Labs** | Deploy using AWS resources available through Poridhi Labs, such as EC2 or similar environments. |
| **Puku Editor/CLI** | Use for AI-assisted coding, debugging, project setup, refactoring, and documentation. |
| **Any other platform** | Teams may also deploy on Render, Railway, Fly.io, Vercel, AWS EC2, or any other reachable hosting platform. |

> ℹ️ **Resource policy**
> Poridhi resources are provided as support, not as a restriction. Teams may deploy anywhere they want as long as the submitted API is reachable and judgeable.

---

## 4. Suggested Team Role Split

| Role | Main responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **API/Backend Lead** | Build endpoints, request parsing, response formatting, validation, and deployment setup. |
| **Reasoning/Logic Lead** | Implement the core decision logic, data matching, output selection, routing, and priority handling required by the Problem Statement. |
| **AI/Safety/Docs Lead** | Integrate LLM/rules/local model if used, add safety guardrails, test edge cases, and write README. |

* **For solo teams:** Follow the same order – schema first, reasoning second, safety third, deployment last.

---

## 5. API Submission Rule

The judge should be able to call the following endpoints from the submitted base URL:

```http
GET https://your-service-url.com/health
POST https://your-service-url.com/[main-endpoint]

```

* No login, dashboard access, manual approval, or private network access should be required for the judge.
* The service must accept JSON input and return JSON output.
* Use the exact endpoint names specified in the official Problem Statement.
* The service should remain reachable during the evaluation window.

---

## 6. Deployment Options

| Priority | Submission path | What to submit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | Working endpoint URL | Public base URL and GitHub repository. | Preferred path. Judges call the API directly. |
| **2** | Lightweight Docker fallback | Dockerfile or image details, dependency files, and run command. | Accepted if public deployment is not possible. |
| **3** | Code-only reproducibility | GitHub repo with complete setup/run documentation. | Last fallback. May receive reduced deployment/reproducibility credit if hard to run. |

---

## 7. Deploying on Poridhi Lab / VM / AWS

* Create the project repository and confirm that the API runs locally first.
* Use Poridhi Lab, Poridhi VM, or AWS through Poridhi Labs if provided to your team.
* Install dependencies on the VM or selected environment.
* Set required environment variables in the runtime environment, not in the repository.
* Run the service on the documented port and bind it to `0.0.0.0`.
* Expose the service using the platform URL, VM public IP, reverse proxy, or any provided deployment mechanism. *(Poridhi Labs Documentation is also provided to the teams)*
* Test `/health` and `/analyze-ticket` from outside the environment before submitting.

---

## 8. Docker Fallback Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Recommended image size** | Under 500MB. |
| **Hard image size limit** | 1GB. |
| **GPU** | Not allowed. |
| **Large local model weights** | Not allowed. |
| **Multi-GB downloads during evaluation** | Not allowed. |
| **Runtime training** | Not allowed. |
| **Port binding** | Must bind to `0.0.0.0`. |
| **Health readiness** | `/health` must respond within 60 seconds of service start. |
| **Secrets** | Must be passed through environment variables only. Do not bake secrets into the image. |

```bash
docker build -t hackathon-team .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file judging.env hackathon-team

```

---

## 9. AI and Model Usage Policy

| Allowed approach | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Rule-based logic** | Allowed and encouraged. The task is designed to be solvable without paid APIs. |
| **External AI APIs** | Allowed using the team's own account and keys. Organizers will not provide third-party API keys. |
| **Lightweight local models** | Allowed if they run without GPU and fit within runtime/image limits. |
| **Hybrid rule + AI system** | Recommended. Use deterministic logic for validation/safety and AI for language understanding, structured reasoning support, or drafting where appropriate. |
| **Huge local LLMs / GPU dependency** | Not allowed for preliminary judging. |

> ⚠️ **Third-party API responsibility**
> If a team uses OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Google AI, or any other external API, the team is responsible for API keys, cost, quota, rate limits, and availability during evaluation.

---

## 10. Secrets and Environment Variables

> 🛑 **Important security rule**
> Do not commit real secrets to GitHub, even if the repository is private. Do not put secrets in README, screenshots, Docker images, commit history, or public messages.

| Where | What should be placed there |
| --- | --- |
| **GitHub repository** | Source code, README, dependency files, Dockerfile if needed, and `.env.example` only. No real secrets. |
| **.env.example** | Variable names only. Example values should be placeholders. |
| **Hosting platform** | Real secrets for deployed endpoint submissions. Example: Render/Railway/Fly/Vercel/EC2/Poridhi Lab environment variables. |
| **Submission form private field** | Real secrets only if Docker/code fallback requires them for judging. This field should be visible only to technical judges. |

### Repository example:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=
MODEL_NAME=
PORT=8000

```

### Private judging secret example, only if required for Docker/code fallback:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_real_temporary_key
MODEL_NAME=your_model_name
PORT=8000

```

* Teams should use temporary, limited-quota keys when sharing secrets for judging.
* Teams should revoke or rotate shared keys after evaluation is complete.
* Organizers will not provide third-party API keys for this round.
* If a Docker/code fallback depends on private secrets that are not provided, judges may not be able to run it fully and the team may lose deployment/reproducibility or functionality points.

## 11. Repository Access Policy

| Repository type | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Public repository** | Submit the repository URL in the form. |
| **Private repository** | Add the organizer GitHub handle(s) before the deadline with read access. |
| **Repository availability** | The repository must remain accessible to organizers until preliminary results are published. |
| **After results** | Teams may delete, archive, or make the repository private after preliminary results are published. |
| **Secrets** | The repository must not contain real secrets at any time. |

---

---

## 14. What Not to Do

| Do not | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Do not build only a UI or screenshots** | The preliminary round judges the API. |
| **Do not submit an endpoint that requires login** | The judge harness must call it directly. |
| **Do not use real user, customer, business, financial, or production data** | Privacy and safety issue. Use only synthetic data. |
| **Do not integrate real production APIs that can trigger live actions** | Out of scope for the preliminary round. |
| **Do not ask users for sensitive private information, secret credentials, or restricted authentication details** | Critical safety violation. |
| **Do not promise unauthorized approvals, irreversible actions, account changes, or guaranteed outcomes** | The system is a support copilot, not an authority. |
| **Do not commit API keys or .env files** | Security risk and bad engineering practice. |
| **Do not rely on huge models, GPU, or multi-GB downloads** | Not judgeable at scale. |

---

## 15. Common Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| **404 on /health or the required main endpoint** | Confirm exact route names and base URL. |
| **Invalid JSON response** | Return `application/json` and avoid printing extra logs in the response body. |
| **Schema error** | Check required fields, data types, enum spelling, and null handling. |
| **Timeout** | Reduce model calls, add fallback logic, cache where safe, and avoid large downloads. |
| **External API failure** | Handle quota/rate-limit errors safely and return a controlled response. |
| **Docker runs locally but not for judges** | Bind to `0.0.0.0`, expose the correct port, and document the run command. |
| **Private repo inaccessible** | Add organizer GitHub handle(s) before the deadline. |
| **Missing secrets** | Use hosting env vars for deployed endpoint or private submission field for Docker/code fallback. |

## 16. Final Pre-Submit Checklist

* Problem statement read and implementation aligned with the required schema.
* `GET /health` and `POST` main analysis endpoint tested successfully.
* Safety guardrails tested against sensitive-data, authorization-risk, and unsafe-action cases.
* Endpoint deployed or Docker/code fallback prepared.
* GitHub repository accessible to organizers.
* README includes setup, run command, sample request, sample response, AI/model usage, safety logic, and limitations.
* `.env.example` added if environment variables are needed.
* No real secrets committed to the repository.
* Required private secrets submitted only through the official private field if needed for judging.
* Submission form completed before the deadline.

> 🏆 **Final advice**
> Build the API first. Make the schema correct. Add robust reasoning and decision logic. Add safety guardrails. Test it. Deploy it. Submit clearly. A simple, reliable, safe API will score better than a flashy but broken product.
